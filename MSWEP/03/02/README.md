# Step-3-2 of MSWEP

In this folder you can find Python script "Merge.py," used to perform the final merging of all the precipitation products (i.e., TCCIP, IMERG_E, IMERG_F, and TReAD).

## Sample input files in the "input" folder

"All_Weights(_).csv" is obtained from the output of Step-3-1 of MSWEP.
Additional input files are data files and should be self-explanatory.

## Sample output file in the "output" folder

In "New_Data.csv", each row shows the merged precipitation time series for each grid.
