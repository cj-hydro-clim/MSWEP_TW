## Reporting bugs

Please make sure to revise the I/O paths in the scripts before running them.
We will update the scripts to make them more versatile in the future; meanwhile if you find any bugs, please raise an issue on GitHub and/or send me an email to [cjchen@nchu.edu.tw](mailto:cjchen@nchu.edu.tw).
